# What are Promises in JavaScript and how do they work?:

## Description: Define Promises in JavaScript and explain how they are used to handle asynchronous operations.

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual **completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.**
It is a way to deal with asynchronous code in a more organized and manageable manner.

Here's how Promises work:

1. **Creation of a Promise:** To create a Promise, you use the `new Promise()` constructor, passing in a function with
   two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. Inside this function, you perform the asynchronous operation. The `resolve`
   function is called when the operation is successful, and the `reject` function is called when it encounters an error.

   ```javascript
   const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Perform asynchronous operation
     if (operationIsSuccessful) {
       resolve(result);
     } else {
       reject(error);
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Handling Promise States:** Promises can be in one of **three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.** When a
   Promise is first created, it is in the pending state. After the asynchronous operation completes, the Promise
   transitions to either the fulfilled state (if `resolve` is called) or the rejected state (if `reject` is called).

3. **Consuming Promises:** You can consume the result of a Promise using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. The
   `.then()` method is called when the Promise is fulfilled, and you can access the resolved value inside it. The
   `.catch()` method is called when the Promise is rejected, and you can handle errors inside it.

   ```javascript
   myPromise
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle successful result
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle error
     });
   ```

4. **Chaining Promises:** Promises can be chained together using the `.then()` method. This allows you to perform
   multiple asynchronous operations sequentially.

   ```javascript
   myPromise
     .then((result) => {
       // Perform another asynchronous operation
       return anotherPromise;
     })
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle result of second operation
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle error
     });
   ```

5. **Promise.all():** The `Promise.all()` method takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves
   when all of the input Promises have resolved, or rejects when any one of the input Promises rejects.

   ```javascript
   Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
     .then((results) => {
       // Handle results of all Promises
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle error
     });
   ```

Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript compared to
traditional callback functions. They make it easier to reason about and manage asynchronous code, leading to more
maintainable and scalable applications.

### Example using Promise:

```javascript
function fetchDataWithPromise() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulate fetching data from an API after 2 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchDataWithPromise()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Data fetched with Promise:', data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error fetching data with Promise:', error);
  });
```

### Example using Callback:

```javascript
function fetchDataWithCallback(callback) {
  // Simulate fetching data from an API after 2 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    callback(null, data);
  }, 2000);
}

function cb(error, data) {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data with Callback:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Data fetched with Callback:', data);
  }
}
fetchDataWithCallback(cb);
```

In the Promise example, we create a `fetchDataWithPromise` function that returns a Promise. Inside the Promise, we
simulate fetching data **from an API after 2 seconds using** `setTimeout`. When the data is fetched successfully, we
call `resolve` with the data object. We then use `.then()` to handle the resolved data and `.catch()` to handle any
errors.

In the callback example, we create a `fetchDataWithCallback` function that accepts a callback function as a parameter.
Inside the function, we simulate fetching data from an API after 2 seconds using `setTimeout`. When the data is fetched
successfully, we call the callback function with `null` as the error argument and the data object as the data argument.
We then check for errors in the callback and handle them accordingly.
