Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript: Describe the differences in scope, hoisting, and
mutability between let, const, and var in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, `let`, `const`, and `var` are used to declare variables, but they have differences in terms of scope,
hoisting, and mutability:

1. **Scope**:

   - **`var`**: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the
     function in which they are defined, or globally if they are declared outside of any function.
   - **`let` and `const`**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped. This means that their scope is
     limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces `{}`) in which they are defined, such as a loop, conditional
     statement, or function.

2. **Hoisting**:

   - **`var`**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means that
     you can access `var` variables before they are declared, but they will be `undefined` until their actual
     declaration in the code.
   - **`let` and `const`**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of their block, but they
     are not initialized. Accessing them before their declaration will result in a ReferenceError.

3. **Mutability**:
   - **`var` and `let`**: Variables declared with `var` and `let` can be reassigned new values.
   - **`const`**: Variables declared with `const` are constants and cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable is an
     object or an array, its properties or elements can still be modified.

Here's a summary:

- Use `var` for variables that need to have function scope or global scope and when you need hoisting behavior.
- Use `let` for variables that need to have block scope and can be reassigned.
- Use `const` for variables that need to have block scope and should not be reassigned. However, remember that `const`
  does not make objects or arrays immutable; it just prevents reassignment of the variable itself.
