# JavaScript Interview Question: Remove Duplicate Elements from an Array

## Question

Given an array of integers that may contain duplicate values, write a JavaScript program to:

1. Remove duplicate elements from the array.
2. Preserve the original order of elements.
3. Use basic JavaScript concepts (loops and objects) without built-in methods like `Set`.

### Example Input

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7, 4, 5];
```

## Answer

To solve this problem, we can use a plain JavaScript object to keep track of elements that have already been
encountered. As we iterate through the array, we check whether the current element exists in the object. If it does not,
we add it to both the object and a new array that stores unique values.

This approach ensures:

- Duplicate elements are removed
- The original order of elements is preserved
- Time complexity remains efficient at **O(n)**

### JavaScript Code

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7, 4, 5];

const obj = {};
const unique = [];

for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
  const element = arr[index];

  if (!obj[element]) {
    obj[element] = true;
    unique.push(element);
  }
}

console.log('Unique Array:', unique);
console.log('Tracking Object:', obj);
```

---

## Output

```js
Unique Array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 4]
Tracking Object: {1: true, 2: true, 3: true, 4: true, 5: true, 6: true, 7: true}
```

## Key Concepts Tested

- Arrays
- Objects as hash maps
- Loops
- Conditional checks
- Time complexity optimization
